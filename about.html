  <div class="bodies1">
    <p>This website was made for my school's personal project. We were assigned to make a project related to one of the
      UN’s 17 sustainable development goals. This website was created to promote the 4th goal of quality
      education.<br><br>
      <br>This website was made by me with HTML, CSS, and Javascript on Visual Studio Code. It is hosted by w3schools.
